      P3: People. Policy. Politics., is a Strategic Advisory Organisation consisting of globally recognised scholars and
      subject-matter experts across sectors and professions, built to create value-driven solutions in the fields of
      Political Strategics, Image Engineering and CSR Execution Methodology.</p>
      <p>We aim to bridge the gap between National Policies and People by aligning Politics using strategic algorithms. To
      achieve this target we have created a team of able professionals and expertised think-tanks who work as a
      consortium to generate tailor+made solution patterns for our clients. Our team consists of 150+ scholars and
      subject-matter experts across territories.
      In this modern world of New Age Media, 'Image' is supposed to be the most important component that contributes in
      building the Intellectual Property Value (IPV) for an individual or an organisation. Building, Maintaining and
      Stabilising an Image is no more just an important task, but it is rather a priority. We work in depth to form,
      create and stabilise Images across fields of life. We have highly qualified Data Scientists, Gesture Managers,
      Creative Artists and Management Strategists who work together on an end-to-end turnkey model to Engineer Images
      and uplift their IPV, which in turn contributes to their net worth. We aim to create unmatchable inspiring Images
      across sectors for the world.
      Execution of CSR or Corporate Social Responsibility, which lends to the image stabilisation of an individual or
      organisation, is no longer a new term for the world. It is now a global mandate and organisations have been
      instrumental and passionate about creating values across sections of the societies using its CSR structure.
      According to several contemporary data analytics and data scientists, modern day CSR programmes are facing the
      biggest challenge in their Execution Methodology. We have created a High Value Operation Management Team who are
      responsible to map end-to-end turn-key solution algorithms for CSR funds of organisations and execute Operations
      to achieve the desired results. Our Production and Creative Team is equipped to create brand values of CSR-funded
      projects that can be later utilised by the awarding Organisation for uplifting their market value and net worth.</p>
      <p>The three wings in which we function, are designed to create roadmaps for individuals, organisations, ministries
      and governments, through which we can effectively solve public policy-related loopholes and crystalise the concept
      of a perfect Nation.</p>
